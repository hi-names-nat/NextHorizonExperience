", "It depends on only its own generated power, using a combination of storage via organic compounds and photosynthesis. ", "The silicon within and the fungus work symbiotically. It is truly fasinating.", "It doesn't have an operating system or anything, at least not yet. It simply boots into a command line called MIL. ", "I've never heard of it before. Must be only in that world, it was a strange one.", "The folks over there figured out how to symbiotically fuse Plantae and Fungi with tech. No magic, just. Pure biotics.", "It's incredible.", "Though, with one downside.", "It feels. And as such. If it doesn't wanna work, it doesn't work.", "So, uh, don't upset it, huh?", "I've been trying to work with it to make an operating system for it.", "Don't upset it, please. Or all my work might suddenly be gone."])
