It's really hacky. The circuit board is handbuilt using wires and a breadboard that's floating around in there.", "Haha. I'm gonna print a PCB for it at some point. It just takes a bit to... Figure out how to get those here.", "The magic-communication device isn't my own, I actually grabbed it on one of my ventures. in a place where they use magic much the way that low-magic worlds use technology.", "They still use thinking rocks. But it's more of a tool for managing mana, rather than outright doing the thing.", "Anyway-", "I built my own little piece of software on the amiga to be able to get those two to work together. ", "Now it acts as the main management hub station for all of the magic-based devices in the haven.", "It's in no way refined. You'd vomit if i showed you what using it is like.", "But it work for me, and it works for everyone else, so It's okay!"])
