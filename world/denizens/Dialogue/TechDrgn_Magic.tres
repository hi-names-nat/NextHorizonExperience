Passages = Array[String](["Okay. So there's magic, there's mana and there's lifespark (or worldspark). I assure you, you're familiar with all of them, even if it doesn't seem it.", "Magic is the usage of latent mana to achieve tasks. I.E. Summoning a fireball, changing the color of your hair, warping to a different point in your reality. That sort of thing.", "Mana is distinct, detectable latent magic energy. You can store it within yourself, but there is also plenty surrounding you at almost all times.", "You can detect mana. You can detect how it feels, how much is present in a place.", "Have you ever felt like something was wrong when entering a place? Like some core part of you, not your body, but your... you, was screaming to get out of there?", "That's your mana senses. Detecting either concerningly low, or concerningly strange latent mana.", "You can do this because deep within you, you are magic.", "You use mana to exist. Even if you're biological, you still as a creature with sentience leverage magic to be You.", "That's called lifespark. The magic fire within each of us.", "Some are entirely magical. manifesting themselves entirely through the use of magic. .", "I'm jealous of them. Often", "Places also have lifespark. Each reality has its own lifespark, each world in that reality, too. And you can get more and more minute with it until we're talking in absurdities.", "Frostbreak in fact, was once a place without lifespark. Chains feed lifespark from their host realities to frostbreak, a pocket reality.", "Because pocket realities distort worldstreams, the 'highways' that trancend realities. ", "creating a multidimensional network of mana.", "This is also how chains exist, they're natural creations of mana!", "...Sorry.", "This might be one of my special interests.", "Figuring out all of this,", "See, I come from what you'd call a 'low mana' world. We're not overlapping many worldstreams. So magic is usually restricted to lifespark.", "You seem to come from a reality like that, too. ", "I can tell in the way you're reacting to the increased mana content here.", "It was so incredible to figure all this out. Learning that magic is real. that it's everywhere. ", "That it's us.", "It was. A realization for me. I had never believed in 'magic'.", "Because the magic I had been told was magic wasn't magic. it  was nonsense.", "Sorry - I'll stop now!", "I'm sure you have friends who'd also love to talk your ear off about this, too.", "If you have ears, that is. I can't tell. Glasses and everything."])
