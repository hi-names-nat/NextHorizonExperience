"Delicious cake"
(... weird...)
(Want to try something?)
- Try the magical device [if Globals.states_dict["ufq"] == 4]
	(You point the magicReciever at the cake...)
	(Suddenly... You feel something appear behind you.)
	do Globals.set_state("ufq", 5)
	=> END
- Think [if Globals.states_dict["ufq"] == 5]
	(There's something more to this, you can tell.)
	(It makes you deeply uneasy.)
	(You're not sure, but you feel it'd be best to ignore it for now...)
	=> END!
- Nothing interesting here.
	=> END!
